# 😃 PoliteShell 😃

A Linux/Bash style command line shell where you must say please.

Rude requests are rejected while courteous ones get system command execution.

Run politeshell.py for local usage, where real Linux commands modify your own system.

Or connect to the public server to see what others are changing:
