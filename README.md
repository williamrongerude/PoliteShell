# 😃 PoliteShell 😃

A Linux/Bash style command line shell where you must say please.

Politeness is required before commands are executed. Rude requests are rejected while courteous ones get system command execution.

Run politeshell.py to use locally, where real Linux commands modify your own system.

Or connect to the public server to see what others are modifying:
